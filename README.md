# Scan_Ip
I had to scan the network folders in my organization to see which folders the user could access.
I could use the existing software but i wanted to build one myself.
Originally in the program ran serial (each IP at a time) but due to the great time of running I learned Multithreading independently and thus significantly shortened the time.
